## Schedule
During my internship at the company, I arrived at 9:00 am and used the company's coffee machine to grab a cup of coffee and a snack before starting work at 9:30 am. We would typically take a lunch break at 1:00 pm and resumed work at 2:30 pm until 6:30 pm. This gave us a chance to recharge and refocus for the rest of the work day.

On the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) there was nothing to do, which provided a good work-life balance and gave us the opportunity to rest and recharge for the coming work week.

Overall, the schedule was well structured, and the coffee and snack break in the morning was a nice touch that helped me start the day on the right foot. The work-life balance was excellent, and the weekends off were a welcome change from the demands of the job.
