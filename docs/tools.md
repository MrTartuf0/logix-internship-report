# Developer Tools
My internship at Logix was a valuable learning experience that taught me important values like teamwork and problem-solving. Throughout my time at the company, I had the opportunity to work alongside a talented team of developers and collaborate on complex projects. This experience provided me with a deeper understanding of the importance of effective communication, collaboration, and adaptability in a professional setting.

In addition to these important values, I also gained exposure to a number of critical development tools and technologies. Some of the tools that I became proficient in using during my time at Logix include 

## NPM

<div style={{ flex : '1' }}>        
NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language that allows developers to easily share and reuse code. NPM provides a centralized repository of over one million packages that can be installed with a simple command, making it easy for developers to integrate third-party libraries and tools into their projects. Additionally, NPM allows developers to create and publish their own packages, making it a valuable tool for sharing and collaborating on code. NPM is widely used in the JavaScript community and is an essential tool for modern web development.
